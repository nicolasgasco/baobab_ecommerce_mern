# Baobab - Conscious e-commerce
Final project of Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp in 2021. E-commerce selling eco-friendly products. Browse, buy, pay, and rate the available products.

_Except for some minor maintainance to migrate from hosting on Heroku to Render, this project hasn't been touched since July 2021 and is thus a representation of my skills at that point in time. I propably can less React now, but I hope I'm a better developer ðŸ˜€_
